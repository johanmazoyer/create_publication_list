# create_publication_list


This is a set of routines to automatically create a publication list in pdf latex from ADS just by indicated your name.
Works in french and english. 

Main code is create_publist.py which as all the function to create a nice latex publication list.
I also have code based on the same routines to make a list of publication by a group of authors based on keyword but it's harder so use with caution
